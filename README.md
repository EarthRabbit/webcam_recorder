A video recorder using webcam

## using library
import cv2 as cv

## additional function for my own video recorder
changing fourcc and format for various type of recordings

* warnings: opencv doesn't provide H264 fourcc for .mp4 format. *
* so if you want to use H264, you need to install [openH264](https://github.com/cisco/openh264).
